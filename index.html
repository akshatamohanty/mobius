      Möbius is a visual programming environment for creating parametric scripts for generating geometric models. The programming approach integrates imperative and associative programming styles. The associative style of programming is supported through graph-based programming, where the user constructs networks consisting of nodes and wires. (For example, see Sidefx Houdini.) The behaviour of each node is defined either by a set of sub-nodes or by an imperative procedure. The imperative style of programming is supported through blocks-based programming, where the user constructs procedures by creating sequences of code blocks. (For example, see Scratch.)

    <p>
      The imperative procedure performs operations by calling functions in one or more underlying function modules. These function modules consist of files that contain a set of standard Javascript functions. Currently, Möbius includes two function modules: a poly module and nurbs module. The poly module includes a set of polygon modelling functions, and makes use of the jsclipper library. The nurbs module includes a set of nurbs modelling functions, and makes use of verb library.
